Description: An R wrapper for the 'OneMap.Sg' API <https://docs.onemap.sg/>. 
    Functions help users query data from the API and return raw JSON data
    in "tidy" formats. Support is also available for users to retrieve data from multiple API calls 
    and integrate results into single dataframes, without
    needing to clean and merge the data themselves. This package is best suited for users who would 
    like to perform analyses with Singapore's spatial data without having to perform excessive data cleaning.
